######                   **** questions for haiku generator
######                   **** Would it be simpler to create a dictionary to store functions & user input options (ex. 0 - main menu, 4 - display all haikus)  ???
######
######                     ** stylistic nice-to-haves
######                     ** combine generated haiku lines + user written lines
######                      * if there's time, think of more questions to increase possibilities for user to generate a unique haiku.
######
######                      create dict to store diff classifications of haiku lines (cons,lib,idaf,idk) and use d.popitem() to plug in randomly?
